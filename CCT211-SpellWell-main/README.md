# CCT211-SpellWell
Final Project for CCT211: Spell Well 

This game helps those who are struggling with keeping up with school work and or are burnt out from studying and need for a new/unique way of memorizing words. This idea uses a similar feature of “quizlet” where the users are able to input information and descriptions of what they need to memorize. In the site, users can input words that they need practice (or help with) along with their definitions, then during gameplay, players will try to guess words based on the definition that shows on screen.

Therefore it is best to experience this on a windows desktop

This link refers to the problems mac users are having with tkinter:
